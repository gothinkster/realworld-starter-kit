;; -- Default app-db Value  ---------------------------------------------------
;;
;; When the application first starts, this will be the value put in app-db
;; Look in:
;;   1.  `core.cljs` for  "(dispatch-sync [:initialise-db])"
;;   2.  `events.cljs` for the registration of :initialise-db handler
;;
(def default-db {:active-page :home})  ;; what gets put into app-db by default.

;; -- Local Storage  ----------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Part of the conduit challenge is to store a user in localStorage, and
;; on app startup, reload the user from when the program was last run.
;;
(def conduit-user-key "conduit-user")  ;; localstore key

(defn set-user-ls
  "Puts user into localStorage"
  [user]
  (.setItem js/localStorage conduit-user-key (str user)))  ;; sorted-map written as an EDN map

;; Removes user information from localStorge when a user logs out.
;;
(defn remove-user-ls
  "Removes user from localStorage"
  []
  (.removeItem js/localStorage conduit-user-key))

;; -- cofx Registrations  -----------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Use `reg-cofx` to register a "coeffect handler" which will inject the user
;; stored in localStorge.
;;
;; To see it used, look in `events.cljs` at the event handler for `:initialise-db`.
;; That event handler has the interceptor `(inject-cofx :local-store-user)`
;; The function registered below will be used to fulfill that request.
;;
;; We must supply a `sorted-map` but in localStorage it is stored as a `map`.
;;

   (assoc cofx :local-store-user  ;; put the local-store user into the coeffect under :local-store-user
