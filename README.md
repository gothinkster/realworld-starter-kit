# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Gleam + Elli + PGO codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Gleam including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Gleam community styleguides & best practices.
