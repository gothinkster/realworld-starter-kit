# [Mobile Icons (iOS/Android)](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/spec/mobile_icons)

### Using the hosted API

Simply point your [API requests](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api) to `https://conduit.productionready.io/api` and you're good to go!

### Styles/Templates

Unfortunately, there isn't a common way for us to reuse & share styles/templates for cross-platform mobile apps.

Instead, we recommend using the Medium.com [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/medium/id828256236?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medium.reader&hl=en) apps as a "north star" regarding general UI functionality/layout, but try not to go too overboard otherwise it will unnecessarily complicate your codebase (in other words, [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) :)
